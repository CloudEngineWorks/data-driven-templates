A Demonstration of Data Driven Templates (DDT) in AngularJS

Introduction to Angular
-----------------------

Play its game... (Angular's framework conventions are trying to be helpful)
  Angular is 100% JavaScript, so you must work with JS.
    Are you Javascript's [friend, loyal combatant, enimy]? 

  How do you work?
     there is a conflict between Designers and Developers:
  Designers use-this-form  ``` <div my-cool-attr>``` But Developers cannot use dashes in variables...
  so Angular changes is to ``` var myCoolAttr; ```.
  **Angular lets Designers and Developers work well together.**
  

  DRYest framework ever!
  

  Angular is Non-Monolithic (the demise of YUI, no-tears from me).
  plays nice with other JS libs.

  Lets start playing the game called DDT...

    ```Objective: let the data drive the template```
