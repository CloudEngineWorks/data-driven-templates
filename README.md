A Demonstration of Data Driven Templates (DDT) in AngularJS

Angular and higher levels
-------------------------

    Are you Javascript's [friend, enemy, loyal combatant]? 


  DRYest framework ever!
  

  Angular is Non-Monolithic not like th old YUI all-in framework  .
  Angular plays nice with other JS libs.

  Lets start playing
    ```Objective: let the data drive the template``` 

  Say you dont know what the data schema is going to be. It could be nested or flat, it could have long strings or tables of numbers. All of the above perhaps. Lets see if there is a directive that might dynamically handle the rendering of data, nomatter what shape it come in (ahh, any well formed JSON, that is).
