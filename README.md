Demonstration of Data Driven Templates (DDT) in AngularJS

Play its game... (Angular's conventions)
  Javascript and you are [enimes, friends, loyal combatants, in love]? 

  How do you work?
     in my opinion the world went down the wrong track when dashes were welcomed into css
  ``` class="my-cool-style" when it could have been class="my_cool_style" ```
  
  but if you play its game Angular lets designers and developers coexist.
  
  DRYest framework ever.
  
  
Angular is Non-Monolithic (ahh well the demise of YUI, no-tears from me).


Lets start playing the game called DDT...

  Objective: let the data drive the templates
  ```
