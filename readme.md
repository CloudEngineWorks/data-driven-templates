demo1 : is a directive that "changes" its template according to the data 

	When: at load time (only).
	
demo2 : adds the ability to change the template when a watched variable changes.

	Why: wont it change the model (for some types)?
	
demo3 : fix the scope and the shadowing of JavaScript's prototypical inheritance ;P

	Where: to put the templates "out of the controller" (I mean really).

demo4 : cleaned up mostly, time to get adventurous and go recursive templates.

	What?: it works
