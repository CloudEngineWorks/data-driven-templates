**demo1 : shows a directive that "changes" its template according to the content data **
[http://nmorse.github.io/data-driven-templates/demo_1.html]

	When: at load time (only).
	
demo2 : adds the ability to change the template when a watched variable changes.

	Why: wont it change the model?
	
demo3 : fix the scope and the shadowing of JavaScript's prototypical inheritance ;P

	Where: to put the templates "out of the controller" (I mean really).

demo4 : cleaned up mostly, time to get adventurous and go recursive.

	What: it works
