	Who : Nate Morse  (will migrate to the highest level language that still Turing complete)

demo1 : is a directive that "changes" its template according to the data 

	When: at load time (only).
	
**demo2 : adds the ability to change the template when a watched variable changes.**[http://nmorse.github.io/data-driven-templates/demo_2.html]

	Why: wont it change the model (for some types)?
	
demo3 : fix for the shadowing of JavaScript's prototypical inheritance ;P

	Where: to put the templates? "Out of the controller" (I mean really).

demo4 : cleaned up mostly, time to get adventurous and try nested templates.

	What?: it works, if time allows, what else 
	
demo5 : more directives and how they interact with the content data

	How : many can we combine???
